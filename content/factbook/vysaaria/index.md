Welcome to the Vysaaria site! This is my far from my first attempt to create a Wiki for Vysaaria, but this is the first time I've tried a Static Website to accomplish this.

## Overview
**{{< icon "vysFlag" >}} Vysaaria** is a Federal Parliamentary Semi-Constitutional Monarchy<cite>[^1]</cite> situated along most of the southern coast of the Continent of Aloria. Officially known as the 
**Kingdom and Lands of the Vysaarii People**, it consists of 11 provinces, and a single Autonomous Protectorate<cite>[^2]</cite> known as Kyrilia. These seperate polities are
broadly united through history, culture and geography, having developed alongside eachother and even fought in the past. Despite this, altogether these polities make up one of the major
powers of the Continent.

Vysaaria acts primarily as a unitary state, despite its provinces and the special case of Kyrilia. The different constituent polities nonetheless maintain local Governance,
Police Forces, and varying levels of Customary Law. The National Government still maintains absolute authority to determine foreign policy, national defense, citizenship, currency, and
many other sections of Law. The colloquial name _Vysaaria_ simply means Lands of the Vysaarii, a term that that doesn't refer to a specific ethnicity or individual customs, 
but rather to the collective culture established in the country throughout its existance. 

The capital city of Vysaaria is Hochenau, located north of Dygurschaff along the eastern banks of the Wyndsaar Straights. 

While it is united primarily through its history, national culture and geography, it is nonetheless a linguistically and culturally diverse nation, with several officially recognised
languages in use by local and national governmental bodies. The national education system broadly uses Tyvoni, a Creole that developed in the region based both on earlier local dialects and
even contemporary languages, and that is broadly mutually interpretable with other languages spoken throughout Vysaaria. 

Hasteig Constitution<cite>[^5]</cite>,

[^1]: While there is Universal Sufferage and a Parliament is elected, the Crown maintains a limited level of power to help protect the country in times of crisis, though this is not without
its critics.
[^2]: Despite being autonomous in nature, Kyrilia is nonetheless a mostly integrated protectorate of the Kingdom of Vysaaria, and falls under a unified Foreign and Defense policy, while
maintaining its own seperate legislature.
[^3]: The Hasteig Constitution was a document signed in 11,768 by Queen Anja II that established a unitary parliamentary system, but reserved emergency powers to the Crown.
[^4]: Each of the provinces is based directly on older Feudal titles, such as Duchies, Counties, Viscounties and Baronies. Though local customs vary wildly throughout the provinces, the
Crown ultimately has final say on the holders of these titles, choosing families primarily based on merit or historical contributions.
[^5]: In 11,602 Feudalism was abolished by King August I by royal decree, removing the legal distinction of class. Though titles still continued to exist, and Noble families continued to
own large swathes of land, most of that land was slowly appropriated by or sold to the Crown, and sold off or granted to other institutions.

## History

## Government
Vysaaria's government is officially defined as a Federal Parliamentary Semi-Constitutional Monarchy, though the _Hasteig Constitution_<cite>[^3]</cite> defines the state under Article 1a as
"[...] a Constitutional Monarchy, where Political Power emanates from the People, while Stability emanates from the Crown". The term Crown refers both to the legal institution of the
monarchy and the National Government. 

### Constitution

The Constitution of Vysaaria, officially known as the _Hasteig Constitution_<cite>[^3]</cite>, was established in its current form in 11,768 by Queen Anja II. It established a separation
of powers between the Crown, Legislative Assembly, Provincial Assembly, Royal Judiciary and Council of High Lords.

#### Legislative Assembly
The Legislative Assembly is a representative body elected nationally under a system of universal, equal, direct, and secret suffrage according to the principles of approval voting 
and proportional representation. The Legislative Assembly is headed by a Chancellor of its own choice, who is the leader of a majority coalition government when one exists. In the absence
of a majority, the Crown may appoint a Chancellor from a list of recommendations put forward by the Legislative Assembly itself. 

The Legislative Assembly's meetings are legally required to be public, unless a subject is considered highly sensitive and two-thirds of the Assembly agree to classify that session. Furthermore,
the Legislative Assembly is required to release true and accurate reports of its proceedings to the public no later than 7 days after the session, unless it was classified. All resolutions
of the Legislative Assembly require a simple majority other than Constitutional Amendments, and all votes must similarly be reported to the public. Classified sessions are declassified 
automatically 10 years after they are held, with a true and accurate report released to the public including all votes held, unless otherwise extended with authorisation of the Crown and
the Royal Judiciary. 

#### Crown
The Monarch is chosen by method of Absolute Cognatic Tanistry, meaning that any member of the Royal Family may be elected to the position of Monarch
regardless of age, gender or relation to the previous Monarch. They are chosen by a group known as the _Prince-Electors_, each of which represents one of the 11 provinces and often is
simultaneously regional governor of that same province. 

The Office of Prince-Elector of a province varies greatly throughout the provinces, though they must be of the family that holds the title related to that province<cite>[^4]</cite>.
Regardless of local customs, the Prince-Elector ultimately holds substantial political authority both locally and nationally, and often acts as a representative of the province even if
they are not its governor.

#### Provincial Estate
Despite the unicameral nature of the Legislative Assembly, the Provincial Estate exists as a primarily advisory body assembled at the request of the Crown. Its primary duty is to represent
the States, with the Governors of each state acting as representative or choosing one in their absence. While not a permnantly standing body, it is required to approve of any Constitutional
Amendment passed by the Legislative Assembly. When not assembled, the Provincial Assembly's members are kept informed by the Legislative Assembly's public reportings and are also informed
of all classified sessions within 7 days of them being held.  

Despite not being a permnant fixture of the legislative process, the Provincial Estate offers the provinces the ability to air concerns when they arise, and ensure that they consent to any
change in the Constitution. While not as transparent as the Legislative Assembly, the Provincial Estate nonetheless makes up an important piece in protecting the democratic process and the
local customs of the provinces. 

#### Royal Judiciary
The Royal Judiciary is a fully independent branch of the government in order to create a politically neutral and fair judicial system. Judges are appointed for life after being nominated 
for the post by the Crown, and approved by the Legislative Assembly. Candidates are required to have legal education, judicial experience and prior appointments before being nominated. 
These Judges can be removed by Judicial, Legislative or Crown decision for the execution of any crime, miscarriage of justice, corruption or inadequete physical or mental health. 

#### Council of the High Lords
The High Lords are a formal body of advisors to the Crown, including the Chancellor of the Legislative Assembly. Its other members are appointees of the Crown responsible for different
aspects of the government, or subject matter experts in different fields. It is almost always made up of a Lord High Arbiter who heads the Judiciary, a Lord High Marshal who heads the Army,
a Lord High Admiral who heads the Navy, and several other advisors who are experts in fields such as education, commerce and diplomacy.

The High Lords are not the Cabinet, however, despite the similar role. They are advisory in nature, and support the Crown, while the Chancellor maintains their own Cabinet of Ministers which
hold more direct postings in the civilian government. 

### Provinces
The provinces vary in naming conventions, culture, customs, religion, style of governance and even language across Vysaaria, but they all inherit the name and borders of a Feudal title that
existed prior to the end of Feudalism in 11,602<cite>[^5]</cite>.
